pam_combo is pam_access with an added time field as used in pam_time.

I had a need for pam_access rules to only apply at certain times.
There's probably some way in pam to accomplish this without creating a
whole new module, but I was too stupid to work out how to do it so I
created pam_combo.

pam_combo was mashed together from pam_access.c and pam_time.c by Bill
 Pemberton <wfp5p@virginia.edu>
