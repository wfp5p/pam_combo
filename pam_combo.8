.SH "NAME"
pam_combo \- PAM module for to combine functionality of pam_access and pam_time
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBpam_combo\&.so\fR\ 'u
\fBpam_combo\&.so\fR [debug] [nodefgroup] [noaudit] [accessfile=\fIfile\fR] [fieldsep=\fIsep\fR] [listsep=\fIsep\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The pam_combo PAM module is mainly for access management\&. It combines the logdaemon style login access control from pam_access with the time based control from pam_time\&.
.PP
By default rules for access management are taken from config file
/etc/security/combo\&.conf
if you don\*(Aqt specify another file\&.
.PP
If Linux PAM is compiled with audit support the module will report when it denies access based on origin (host or tty)\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fBaccessfile=\fR\fB\fI/path/to/combo\&.conf\fR\fR
.RS 4
Indicate an alternative
combo\&.conf
style configuration file to override the default\&. This can be useful when different services need different access lists\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdebug\fR
.RS 4
A lot of debug information is printed with
\fBsyslog\fR(3)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBnoaudit\fR
.RS 4
Do not report logins from disallowed hosts and ttys to the audit subsystem\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBfieldsep=\fR\fB\fIseparators\fR\fR
.RS 4
This option modifies the field separator character that pam_combo will recognize when parsing the combo configuration file\&. For example:
\fBfieldsep=|\fR
will cause the default `:\*(Aq character to be treated as part of a field value and `|\*(Aq becomes the field separator\&. Doing this may be useful in conjunction with a system that wants to use pam_combo with X based applications, since the
\fBPAM_TTY\fR
item is likely to be of the form "hostname:0" which includes a `:\*(Aq character in its value\&. But you should not need this\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBlistsep=\fR\fB\fIseparators\fR\fR
.RS 4
This option modifies the list separator character that pam_combo will recognize when parsing the combo configuration file\&. For example:
\fBlistsep=,\fR
will cause the default ` \*(Aq (space) and `\et\*(Aq (tab) characters to be treated as part of a list element value and `,\*(Aq becomes the only list element separator\&. Doing this may be useful on a system with group information obtained from a Windows domain, where the default built\-in groups "Domain Users", "Domain Admins" contain a space\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBnodefgroup\fR
.RS 4
User tokens which are not enclosed in parentheses will not be matched against the group database\&. The backwards compatible default is to try the group database match even for tokens not enclosed in parentheses\&.
.RE
.SH "MODULE TYPES PROVIDED"
.PP
All module types (\fBauth\fR,
\fBaccount\fR,
\fBpassword\fR
and
\fBsession\fR) are provided\&.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
PAM_SUCCESS
.RS 4
Access was granted\&.
.RE
.PP
PAM_PERM_DENIED
.RS 4
Access was not granted\&.
.RE
.PP
PAM_IGNORE
.RS 4

\fBpam_setcred\fR
was called which does nothing\&.
.RE
.PP
PAM_ABORT
.RS 4
Not all relevant data or options could be gotten\&.
.RE
.PP
PAM_USER_UNKNOWN
.RS 4
The user is not known to the system\&.

.SH "AUTHORS"
.PP
The logdaemon style login access control scheme was designed and implemented by Wietse Venema\&. The pam_access PAM module was developed by Alexei Nogin <alexei@nogin\&.dnttm\&.ru>\&. pam_time was written by Andrew G\&. Morgan <morgan@kernel\&.org>\&. The IPv6 support and the network(address) / netmask feature was developed and provided by Mike Becher <mike\&.becher@lrz\-muenchen\&.de>\&. pam_combo was stuck together from pam_time and pam_access by Bill Pemberton <wfp5p@virginia\&.edu>
